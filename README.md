# SuperScoreboard

For all of your up to the minute football scores from around the globe.

1. ## How to set up and run the project

   - Ensure Xcode 16.4 or later is installed
   - Open the `SuperScoreboard.xcworkspace` workspace
   - Select the `SuperScoreboard` target and click run (or `CMD + R`)

2. ## Complete the task

   - Use the data already being fetched by the app to bring the provided [Figma designs](https://www.figma.com/design/hY3cElxFKc1mkl9oZ8GAi4/Test-Design?node-id=1-61823&t=IbXirDv081k0WauS-1) to life.
   - Aim to match the look and feel of the designs as closely as possible.
   - Show us your best practices when it comes to modelling data and presenting it on screen.
   - Write code that is testable, and add tests to demonstrate it.
   - You’re welcome to adjust or refactor any of the starter code if it helps your approach, it's simply there to get you started.
   - Make sure data fetching includes proper loading and error states.
   - If something about the design or data isn’t clear, make sensible assumptions—we’ll cover them in the review. Not everything is available, so be prepared to think on your feet!
   - You can bring in 3rd party frameworks if they add value, but be ready to explain your reasoning. We want you to focus on demonstrating solid engineering, not relying what other people can do.
   - Feel free to use the latest features from the OS, toolset, or language. There are no restrictions on minimum support.

3. ## Document and deliver

   - At the bottom of this README, include a short section with your notes.
   - Outline your approach, highlight any trade-offs you made, and call out assumptions around the data or designs.
   - This helps us understand your thinking and makes the review process smoother.
   - When you’re finished, share the completed project with us. You can either:
      - Push it to a public or private GitHub repository and share access, or
      - Send it as a zipped project folder.
